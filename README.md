# GrokApi

The is an experiment out of curiosity to see if Grok, X's Brand new AI can be used programmatically.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add grok_api

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install grok_api

## Usage
You'll need to set the following environment variables:
 - `GROK_BEARER_TOKEN`. The `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` etc. that comes after `Bearer`
 - `GROK_COOKIE`. Starts with `guest_id=v1%3A168`
 - `GROK_CSRF_TOKEN`. Started with `b4caa52c` in my case.

To get these, open X.com, access Grok and open the Javascript Console. Make sure the Network panel is selected and the session is being recorded.
Then perform a query on grok. Filter on `Fetch/XHR` to find a valid request. Copy the request with headers. I used Copy as cURL.

You can apply this at the top of your script, as long as you don't share that section with others:
```ruby
ENV['GROK_BEARER_TOKEN'] = 'your_token_string_here'
ENV['GROK_COOKIE'] = 'your_cookie_string_here'
ENV['GROK_CSRF_TOKEN'] = 'your_csrf_token_here'
```

Then you can start a conversation and chat with Grok:
```ruby
client = GrokApi::Client.new
client.start_conversation
client.chat do
  say "Is the Improbability Drive incredible, or just highly improbable?"
  chat!
end
```

The chat will be printed by default:
```md
2023-12-21 01:24:00 +0100: ðŸ’¬ New conversation started on "Is the Improbability Drive incredible, or just hig"
2023-12-21 01:24:00 +0100: ðŸ’¬ You: Is the Improbability Drive incredible, or just highly improbable?
Going to send request... ConversationId: 1737623745068449792
2023-12-21 01:24:00 +0100: ðŸ¤– Grok: The Improbability Drive is, in fact, incredibly improbable. It's so improbable that it's almost impossible, which is what makes it so incredible. It's like finding a functioning smartphone in a pile of rocks - highly improbable, yet quite incredible if it actually happens.
```

## ToDo's:
- [ ] auto start a conversation if we don't have one yet `start_conversation unless @conversationId`
- [ ] use streaming API to parse messages during flushing of the output buffer

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
